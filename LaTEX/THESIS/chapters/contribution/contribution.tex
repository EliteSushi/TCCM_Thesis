\chapter*{Contribution Statement}

Prof. Thomas Jagau made the initial suggestion of studying non-valence states of biological molecules using EA-EOM-CC2, building on the work of Dr. Garrette Paran. I made the proposal to study the case of ubiquinone. I also prepared the system and performed all calculations and analysis. Of course, my supervisors helped me along the way with experimental design, evaluation of results and other insights. The thesis is written by me with minor corrections from my supervisors.
