\section{Self Consistent Field Methods} \label{sec:SCF}
The objective of any quantum chemist is to solve the BL BLA BLA:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:TISE}
    \hat{H}_e \Psi_e = E_e \Psi_e
\end{equation}

The Hartree-Fock (HF) method stands as a method in electronic structure theory. Its primary objective is to provide an approximate solution to the many-electron time-independent Schrödinger equation within the Born-Openhaimer approximation, which governs the behavior of electrons within atoms and molecules:
The HF method achieves this by assuming that each electron moves independently within an average electrostatic field generated by the other electrons in the system. In the HF method the \textit{N}-electron wavefunction is represented by a Slater determinant, which is formed by taking the antisymmetrized product of N individual one-electron spin-orbitals ($\chi$):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SlaterDet}
    \Psi(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2, \dots, \mathbf{r}_N) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
    \begin{vmatrix}
      \chi_1(\mathbf{r}_1) & \chi_2(\mathbf{r}_1) & \cdots & \chi_N(\mathbf{r}_1) \\
      \chi_1(\mathbf{r}_2) & \chi_2(\mathbf{r}_2) & \cdots & \chi_N(\mathbf{r}_2) \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \chi_1(\mathbf{r}_N) & \chi_2(\mathbf{r}_N) & \cdots & \chi_N(\mathbf{r}_N)
    \end{vmatrix}
  \end{equation}
The choice of using a deteminant inherently satisfies both the Pauli exclusion principle, and the antisymmetry requirement of fermions. The energy expectation for a Slater determinant according to HF is variational and can be computed as:
\begin{equation}\label{EHF} %FIX THIS
    \begin{aligned}
        E_{HF} &= \sum_{i=1}^{N} \hat{F}_i \Psi \\
            &= \sum_{i=1}^{N} \hat{h}(i) + \sum_{i,j=1}^{N} (2\hat{J}_j(i) - \hat{K}_j(i)) \\ 
            &= \sum_{i=1}^{N} \langle \chi_i | \hat{h} | \chi_i \rangle + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^{N} \langle \chi_i \chi_j || \chi_i \chi_j \rangle
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Where, $\hat{F}$ is the Fock operator. $\hat{F}$ is made up from $\hat{h}$, the one-electron core Hamiltonian operator (kinetic energy and electron-nucleus attraction); $\hat{J}_j(i)$, the Coulomb operator, describing the electrostatic repulsion between electron i and the average charge distribution of electron j, and $\hat{K}_j(i)$ is the exchange operator, a purely quantum mechanical term arising from the antisymmetry principle. \\
The Hartree-Fock equations are inherently non-linear: because the Fock operator depends on the wavefunctions of all the other electrons, their interactions are coupled. Consequently, these equations cannot be solved analytically and are solved using an iterative procedure known as the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) method.

\subsection{Electron Correlation}
\label{subsec:electron_correlation}
%Say explicitly that HF recovers the exchange energy
SAY EXPLICITLY THAT HF RECOVERS EXCH E
The Hartree-Fock (HF) method is inherently limited by its neglect of the instantaneous interactions of electrons. In the HF approximation, each electron is treated as moving independently within a static, average field created by the other electrons. This mean-field approach fails to account for the fact that electrons will instantaneously repel each other, leading to a dynamic correlation in their movements as they try to avoid each other in space.\\
This leads to an overestimation of the electron-electron repulsion energy, and an inability to accurately predict certain phenomena, such as London dispersion forces. The difference between the exact non-relativistic energy of the system and the energy obtained in the Hartree-Fock complete basis limit is defined as the correlation energy and is always negative due to the variational principle. Correlated methods aim to include the effects of the instantaneous interactions between electrons that are neglected in the mean-field approximation of HF theory. In the following sections, everal correlated methods relevant to this work are presented.

\subsection{Møller-Plesset Perturbation Theory}
Møller-Plesset (MP) perturbation theory offers a way to improve upon the HF energy by the use of Raylei-Schro perturbation theory: the electron correlation is treated as a perturbation to the HF Hamiltonian. The energy and wavefunction are then expanded as a series in terms of the perturbation strength. The first-order energy correction in MP theory is zero, so the first non-trivial correction to the HF energy appears at the second order, giving rise to the MP2 method. The MP2 energy correction for a closed-shell molecule is given by:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:MP2}
    E_{\mathrm{MP2}} = - \frac{1}{4} \sum_{ij}^{\mathrm{occ}} \sum_{ab}^{\mathrm{virt}} \frac{|\langle i j || a b \rangle|^2}{\epsilon_a + \epsilon_b - \epsilon_i - \epsilon_j}
\end{equation}
Where $i,j$ denote occupied molecular orbitals, $a,b$ denote virtual molecular orbitals, and $\epsilon$ are the corresponding orbital energies from the HF calculation. MP theory can be extended to higher orders (MP3, MP4, etc.) to achieve greater accuracy, although the computational cost increases significantly with each order. The computational cost of MP2 scales as $O(N^5)$.

\subsection{Density Functional Theory}
Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides an alternative approach to incorporating electron correlation by parametrizing the energy on the electron density rather than the wavefunction, reducing the degrees of freedom of the system from $3N-3$ to just $3$. In the most commonly used form of DFT, the Kohn-Sham method, the prpblem is formulated terms of orbitals that are not physical, but are chosen to reproduce the electron density of the system. The fundamental principle of DFT is that the ground state energy of a system is a unique functional of its electron density:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:KSDFT}
    \left( -\frac{1}{2} \nabla^2 + \hat{V}_{\mathrm{ext}}(\mathbf{r}) + \hat{V}_\mathrm{H}(\mathbf{r}) + \hat{V}_{\mathrm{XC}}[\rho(\mathbf{r})] \right) \psi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon_i \psi_i(\mathbf{r})
\end{equation}
Where $\hat{V}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ respresents the external potential, $\hat{V}_\mathrm{H}(\mathbf{r}) = \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|} d\mathbf{r}'$ is the Hartree potential, $\hat{V}_{\mathrm{XC}}$ is the Exchange-Correlation potential and $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ is the electron density. The exchange-correlation functional is the most challenging part of DFT, as it is not known exactly and must be approximated. The accuracy of DFT calculations depends heavily on the choice of exchange-correlation functional. The computational cost of DFT scales as $O(N^4)$.

\subsection{Configuration Interaction}
Configuration Interaction (CI) methods improve upon HF by expressing the electronic wavefunction as a linear combination of the HF ground state determinant and excited state determinants:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:CI}
     |\Psi_{\mathrm{CI}} \rangle = c_0 |\Phi_0 \rangle + \sum_{ia} c_{ia} |\Phi_{ia} \rangle + \sum_{ijab} c_{ijab} |\Phi_{ijab} \rangle + \dots
\end{equation}
Where $|\Phi_0 \rangle$ is the HF ground state determinant, $|\Phi_{ia} \rangle$ represents a determinant with a hole in spin-orbital \textit{i} and a particle in the spin-orbital \textit{a}, and c are the CI coefficients. Full CI (FCI),  includes all possible excitations within a given one-electron basis set and represents the exact solution to the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation in that basis. However, is computationally prohibitive for all but the simplest systems. Truncated CI methods, such as CISD (singles and doubles), are more practical but lack size extensivity; EXPLAIN SIZE EXTENSIVITY. It is however, size-consistent: EXPLAIN SIZE CONSISTENCY.

\subsection{Coupled Cluster Theory} \label{sec:CCTheory}
Similarly to CI, the coupled cluster CC method expands the wavefunction as a linear combination of Slater determinats. However, the CC wavefunction is size-extensive and size-consistent by using an exponential ansatz,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CCWavenfunc}
    | \Psi_{\mathrm{CC}} \rangle = e^{\hat{T}} | \Psi_{0} \rangle
\end{equation}
where $\hat{T}$ is the cluster operator, which is the central component of CC theory and is defined as a sum of excitation operators,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{T} = \hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2 + \hat{T}_3 + \dots + \hat{T}_N
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the total number of electrons in the system. Each term in this sum corresponds to a specific level of excitation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\hat{T}_1 = \sum_{i}^{\text{occ}} \sum_{a}^{\text{virt}} t_i^a a_a^{\dagger} a_i$ represents single excitations.
    \item $\hat{T}_2 = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{i,j}^{\text{occ}} \sum_{a,b}^{\text{virt}} t_{ij}^{ab} a_a^{\dagger} a_b^{\dagger} a_j a_i$ represents double, \textit{coupled} excitations.
    \item Higher-order excitation operators $\hat{T}_3, \hat{T}_4, \dots$ describe coupled excitation of three, four, and more electrons, respectively.
\end{itemize}
The coefficients $t_i^a$, $t_{ij}^{ab}$, etc., are cluster amplitudes to determined by projection of the CC Schr\"{o}dinger equation onto the excited determinants and, likewise, the energy is obtained by projecting onto the HF reference determinant:
\iffalse One of the most significant advantages of coupled cluster theory is its property of size consistency. A size-consistent method correctly describes the energy of a system composed of multiple non-interacting subsystems as the sum of the energies of the individual subsystems. The exponential form, when expanded as a Taylor series,
\begin{equation}
    e^{\hat{T}} = 1 + \hat{T} + \frac{1}{2!} \hat{T}^2 + \dots
\end{equation}
inherently includes terms that represent disconnected clusters, which are essential for size consistency. \fi
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CCEnergy}
    E_{\mathrm{CC}}=\langle \Psi_{0} | e^{-\hat{T}} \hat{H} e^{\hat{T}} | \Psi_{0} \rangle
\end{equation}
Using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion, the exponential operators in Eq. \ref{eq:CCEnergy} can be simplified to a series of commutators which ends at the fourth order. The cluster operator $\hat{T}$ can be truncated at different levels of excitation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CCD} (Coupled Cluster Doubles): This is the simplest approximation in the CC family, where the cluster operator is truncated to include only double excitations: $\hat{T} \approx \hat{T}_2$. There is no CC Singles since the Brilluin's theorem implies that the amplitudes of single excitations alone are null. 
    \item \textbf{CCSD} (Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles): This is one of the most widely used and generally accurate \textit{ab initio} methods, where the cluster operator includes both single and double excitations: $\hat{T} \approx \hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2$.
    \item \textbf{CCSDT} (Coupled Cluster Singles, Doubles, and Triples): $\hat{T} \approx \hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2 + \hat{T}_3$.
    \item \ldots
\end{itemize}
The hierarchy can be extended to include even higher levels of excitation,  with the properties converging to the FCI limit. The computational cost of CC methods increases rapidly with the level of truncation, as shown in Table \ref{tab:qc_scaling}.

\subsection{Second Approximate Coupled Cluster}\label{sec:CC2Theory}
Second Approximate Coupled Cluster (CC2) belongs to the broader family of CCn approximate coupled cluster methods, where the `n' in CCn indicates the truncation of the cluster operator within a perturbative hierarchy. These methods aim to reduce the computational cost associated with standard CC truncations while still retaining a reasonable level of accuracy.\\

In CC2, the equations for the single amplitudes, $t^a_i$, are the same as CC theory (Eq. \ref{eq:CCWavenfunc}) under the constraint that the doubles amplitudes, $t^{ab}_{ij}$, are calculated using the non-iterative expression for MP2 (Eq \ref{eq:MP2}). The resulting expression for the CC2 correlation energy is:
\begin{equation}\label{CC2Energy}
    E_{\mathrm{CC2}} = \sum_{ij}^{\mathrm{occ}} \sum_{ab}^{\mathrm{virt}} \frac{1}{4}\frac{|\langle i j || a b \rangle|^2}{\epsilon_a + \epsilon_b - \epsilon_i - \epsilon_j}  + \sum_{i}^{\mathrm{occ}} \sum_{a}^{\mathrm{virt}} \hat{F}_{ai} t^a_i 
\end{equation}
The perturbative treatment of the doubles amplitudes in CC2, reduces the computational cost compared to CCSD, Table \ref{tab:qc_scaling}. While this approximation can lead to a less accurate description of electron correlation, the inclusion of singles amplitudes allows for an approximate description of orbital relaxation, which often leads to higher quality wavefunction, and hence properties, compared to MP2.

\section{Equation-of-Motion Methods} \label{sec:eom_theory}
Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster (EOM-CC) methods are an extension of ground-state coupled cluster theory which provide a framework for calculating a variety of excited (EE), ionized (IP) and electron-attached (EA) states. In the EOM-CC, the target electronic state is generated by applying a linear excitation operator $\hat{R}$ to a reference state, which typically is the coupled cluster wavefunction of the ground state. The target state wavefunction can then be expressed as $|\Psi_{\mathrm{EOM}}\rangle = \hat{R} |\Psi_{\mathrm{CC}}\rangle = \hat{R} e^{\hat{T}} |\Phi_{\mathrm{HF}}\rangle$. Figure \ref{fig:EOM}, shows some of the determinats of $| \Psi_{\mathrm{EA}} \rangle$, where the target state has one more $\mathrm{\alpha}$ electron. \\

The form of the operator $\hat{R}$ is similar to the cluster operator and chosen to access the desired target state. In the case of EOM-EA, the electron attachment operator $R^{\text{EA}}$ includes terms that describe the creation of one electron to an unoccupied orbital, terms that describe the creation of one electron accompanied by the excitation of another electron from an occupied to an unoccupied orbital, and so on:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:R_EA}
    \hat{R}^{\mathrm{EA}} = \hat{R}_1^{\mathrm{EA}} + \hat{R}_2^{\mathrm{EA}} + \ldots = \sum_{a} r^a a_a^{\dagger} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ab} \sum_{i} r^{ba}_{i} a_b^{\dagger} a_a^{\dagger} a_i + \ldots
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \medskip
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{EOM_EA}
    \caption{EOM-EA.}
    \label{fig:EOM}
  \end{figure}
  Where $a$ and $b$ denote virtual orbitals, $i$ denotes an occupied orbital, and $r^a$ and $r^{ba}_{i}$ are the coefficients to be determined. By truncating at the same excitation level as the cluster operator, the method is rigorously size-extensive and size-consistent. The EA energies, or any other EOM energy, can be obtained as the eigenvalues of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H}_{\mathrm{N}}$:
\begin{equation}
    \bar{H}_{\mathrm{N}} \hat{R} | \Psi_0 \rangle = \Delta E_{\mathrm{EOM}} \hat{R} | \Psi_0 \rangle
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \bar{H}_{\mathrm{N}} = e^{-\hat{T}} \hat{H} e^{\hat{T}} - \langle \Psi_0 | e^{-\hat{T}} \hat{H} e^{\hat{T}} | \Psi_0 \rangle
\end{equation}
Since the similarity trnasformed hamiltonian is non-hermitian, the left and right are different but correspond to the same eigenvalues. This means that the properties have `right' and `left' expectation values. \\
The strength of the EOM-CC ansatz is the use of a closed shell reference to access open shell states, which are eigenfunctions of the $\hat{S}^2$ operator. The EOM-CC methods are also size-extensive and size-consistent. The computational cost of EOM-CC methods is similar to that of the corresponding ground-state CC methods.

\section{Dyson orbitals}

Dyson orbitals are defined as the overlap between the wavefunction of an initial $N$-electron state ($|\Psi_0^N\rangle$) and the wavefunction of the final state with $N\pm1$ electrons ($|\Psi_f^{N\pm1}\rangle$).
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dyson} %INTEGRAL
    \phi_{d} = \langle \Psi_0^N | \Psi_f^{N\pm1} \rangle
\end{equation}
Because the the terms differ in one electron, the result of the overlap is a vector instead of a scalar, and can be expressed as a linear combination of the molecular orbitals ($\phi_p(r)$) of the reference wavefunction:
\begin{equation}
    \phi_{d}(r) = \sum_p \gamma_p \phi_p(r)
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_p$ are the coefficients that quantify the contribution of each molecular orbital to the Dyson orbital.\\

Physically, Dyson orbitals can be interpreted as the correlated analog to the orbital of the electron that is either removed or attached. 

They can be used for the interpretation and prediction of photoelectron spectra as they contain all the information required to calculate diffrential corss-sections, $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega_k}$:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega_k} = \frac{4\pi^2kE}{c}|\langle \phi_d | \mu | \Psi^{el}_k \rangle |^2
\end{equation}
where where \textit{k} is the magnitude of the photoelectron wavevector, \textit{E} is the energy of the ionizing radiation, and \textit{c} is the speed of light, $\mu$ is the dipole operator, and $\Psi^{el}_k$ is the photoelectron wavefunction, and a strong orthonormality is assumed between the reference and continuum wavefunction.
