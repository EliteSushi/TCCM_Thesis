## Supporting Information for the Thesis

This repository contains supplementary materials related to the thesis. Below is a breakdown of the contents:

### Plot_Data
[plot_data](./plot_data/CH4.dat) includes raw data for all graphs presented in the thesis.

### Sample_Out
[sample_out](./sample_out/README.md) provides sample output files, which also specify the exact input used for the types of calculations performed.

### Scripts
[scripts](./scripts/README.md) contains PyMOL and Bash scripts used to generate structures and input files for the calculations. These scripts enable reproduction of all calculations described in the thesis.

### Structures
[structures](./structures/Q0_grid.xyz) provides explicit `.xyz` structures for Q0 and Q1 grids.

### Figures_Dyson
[Figures_Dyson](./Figures_Dyson/azulene.png) contains Dyson orbital figures generated using PyMOL and a custom script for producing cube files from Q-Chem output. The figures were styled using a provided `style.pml` script.
